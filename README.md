# benchmark_sparse_conv
simple benchmark around spatially sparse convolutions

- [x] Push our "pedagogic" sparse conv
- [x] Test against https://github.com/traveller59/spconv (this one is much much faster)
- [ ] Do graphs
- [ ] Test against dense convolutions
- [ ] Test against Sparse Blockhttps://github.com/uber-research/sbnet
